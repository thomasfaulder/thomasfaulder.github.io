    <h1>Health in North Queensland </h1>
    
    <h2>Tropical disease</h2>
    
    <h3>Dengue Fever</h3>
    <p><b>Transmission</b></p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Transmitted by Dengue mosquitoes which have small, frequent meals of blood.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Symptoms last 3-7 days.</li>

    <h2>Indigenous Health Issues</h2>
    <h3>Trachoma </h3>
    <p><em>Australia is the only developed country with trachoma.</em></p>
    <p>Eye infection from Chlamydia trachomatis. Eyelids turn inwards so eyelashes rub against eyeball. Painful and causes blindness.</p>
    <p><b>Transmission</b></p>
	<p>Direct contact with fluid from eyes or noses of infected people. Flies that have contacted eyes can spread the disease. Bacteria can survive on towels and face cloths.</p>
	<p><b>Management</b></p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Surgery (turning eyelids).</li>
		<li>Antibiotics (kill Chlamydia trachomatis).</li>
        <li>Education - teaching hand and facial cleanliness,ensuring families don't share towels.</li>
	</ul>
    <h3>Rheumatic heart disease </h3>
    <p>98% of Australians diagnosed with rheumatic heart fever are Indigenous or Torres Strait Islanders, because Indigenous communities lag behind in access to health care and general living standards.</p>
    <p><b>Cause</b></p>
	<p>Rheumatic fever causes the heart to dilate, stretching and scarring heart valves. Subsequently, blood flow is abnormal (eg. blood flows backward through valves), eventually leading to heart failure.</p>
	<p><b>Management</b></p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Diagnosed with ultrasound.</li>
		<li>Surgery can manage problems.</li>
        <li>Significant decline due to
        	<ol>
            	<li>Improved health care access for treatment.</li>
                <li>Penicillin has treated streptococcal infections which cause rheumatic fever.</li>
                <li>Improved living standards.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
	</ul>
    <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chest pain.</li>
        <li>Breathlessness with physical activity or lying down.</li>
		<li>Weakness and tiredness.</li>
		<li>Swelling of legs and face.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Respiratory diseases (eg. asthma)</h3>
    <p>Airways irritated so they become inflamed, narrowed, swollen and sometimes blocked by mucus, making it hard to breathe. Twice as common for Indigenous Australians than non-Indigenous Australians. Threatens quality of life.</p>
	<p><b>Risk factors</b></p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Obesity - Indigenous Australians 1.6 times more likely to be obese than non-Indigenous Australians.</li>
		<li>Smoking - smoking rates twice as high for Indigenous Australians.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <h3>Mental health problems</h3>
    <p><b>Causes</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Disadvantage.</li>
        <li>Discrimination - Indigenous may feel ignored, disrespected and misunderstood by non-Indigenous.</li>
		<li>Grief and trauma stemming from feelings of loss from incarceration, illness,  premature deaths and the Stolen Generation.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Possible solutions</b></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Teach Aboriginal culture and history in schools to help Aboriginal children develop cultural identity and pride.</li>
    <li>Educating Aboriginal perspectives on health and wellbeing- eg. strong focus on the importance of family and community.</li>
    <li>Ensuring mainstream health services are culturally informed.</li>
    <li>Giving Aboriginal communities more control over planning, designing and implementing health services to bring Aboriginal expertise and experience into the health care system and establish trust.</li>
    <li>Having more Aboriginal health workers so Indigenous patients feel understood and respected. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Heart Disease</h3>
    <p>Includes Coronary Heart Disease (restricted blood supply to heart muscle caused by the build-up of fatty deposits in the coronary arteries) which can lead to heart attack. Indigenous Australians are twice as likely to be affected by cardiovascular disease than non-Indigenous Australians.</p>
    <p><b>Risk factors</b></p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Smoking - 2/5 Indigenous people smoke.</li>
		<li>High blood pressure - heart works harder and becomes thicker.</li>
        <li>Diabetes - Aboriginal Australians 3x more likely to have diabetes. </li>
	</ul>
    <h3>Chronic kidney disease</h3>
    <p>Kidneys filter waste from the blood. If the kidneys begin to fail, waste and toxins accumulate.</p>
    <p><b>Risk factors</b></p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Heart attack (blood supply to heart blocked) or stroke (blood supply to brain interrupted).</li>
		<li>Overweight.</li>
        <li>Smoking. </li>
	</ul>
    <p><b>Outcomes</b></p>
    <p>May lead to kidney failure. Patients who experience kidney failure may need dialysis or a kidney transplant.</p>
    <p><b>Prevention</b></p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Healthy eating and regular exercise.</li>
        <li>Not smoking.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Diabetes</h3>
    <p><em>1/3 Indigenous Australians develop diabetes.</em> </p>
    <p>Sugar (glucose) gives the body energy.</p>
    <p>Insulin causes glucose to move from the blood into the muscles.</p>
    <p>Diabetes means insulin doesnâ€™t work properly so there is too much glucose in the blood.</p>
    <p><b>Risk factors</b></p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Excessive fatty foods.</li>
        <li>Insufficient exercise.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Many Indigenous health issues stem from social disadvantage. Progress in education and housing could drive significant improvements in Aboriginal health. </p>
